## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

All API calls are made to `http://management.offgridone.net`:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Check device connection |
| `/installed-apps` | GET | Get device information and installed apps |
| `/upload` | POST | Upload single file |
| `/upload-multiple` | POST | Upload multiple files |

### Storage

The PWA uses browser storage for persistence:

**LocalStorage Keys:**

- `applied_updates`: List of applied updates with metadata

**Service Worker Cache:**
- Static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Images and icons
- Offline page

### ZIP File Format

Update ZIP files should contain:

```
update.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ apply_update.json    # Required metadata file
â”œâ”€â”€ file1.bin           # Application files
â”œâ”€â”€ file2.conf
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**apply_update.json Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "Application Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "icon": "ðŸ“¦",
  "new_files": [
    { "path": "/opt/app/file1.bin", "source": "file1.bin" }
  ],
  "old_files": ["/opt/app/old_file.bin"],
  "update_commands": ["systemctl restart app"],
  "caddy_config": {
    "domain": "app.offgridone.local",
    "port": 8080
  },
  "homer_config": {
    "name": "My App",
    "subtitle": "Application",
    "tag": "app",
    "url": "http://app.offgridone.local"
  },
  "service_name": "my-app"
}
```

## Customization

### Changing Theme Colors

Edit `styles.css` variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #00897B;  /* Change primary color */
  --success-color: #4CAF50;  /* Success/applied state */
  --warning-color: #FF9800;  /* Warnings/pending state */
  /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Updating API Endpoint

Edit `app.js` constant:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://management.offgridone.net';
```

### Customizing Service Worker

Edit `service-worker.js` to change:
- Cache name and version
- Cached assets list
- Caching strategy

## Development

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server
python -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Testing Offline

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Application > Service Workers
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Test functionality

### Debugging

**Chrome DevTools:**
- Application tab: Check service worker, storage, manifest
- Console: View logs and errors
- Network tab: Monitor API calls
- Sources tab: Debug JavaScript

**Common Issues:**
- Service worker not updating: Clear cache and reload
- Storage quota exceeded: Clear browser data
- CORS errors: Check API server configuration
- File upload fails: Check file size limits

## Security Considerations

**HTTPS Requirement:**
- Service workers require HTTPS in production
- Exception: localhost for development
- Use a valid SSL certificate for deployment

**API Security:**
- API endpoint uses HTTP (not HTTPS)
- Only use on trusted local networks
- Do not expose to public internet
- Consider VPN for remote access

**File Uploads:**
- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Limit concurrent uploads
- Implement rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Device

**Check:**
- Both devices on same network
- Management API is running
- Firewall not blocking connection
- Correct device IP/hostname

**Try:**
- Restart device
- Restart router
- Check network settings
- Ping device to verify connectivity

### Update Fails

**Check:**
- File is valid ZIP format
- Contains apply_update.json
- File not corrupted
- Sufficient storage on device

**Try:**
- Re-download update file
- Try a different update
- Check device logs
- Verify file permissions

### PWA Won't Install

**Check:**
- Using supported browser
- HTTPS enabled (production)
- Valid manifest.json
- Service worker registered

**Try:**
- Clear browser cache
- Use incognito mode
- Check console for errors
- Try different browser
